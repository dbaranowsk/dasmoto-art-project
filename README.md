# dasmoto-art-project
static website project


This was the first assignment from the Codecademy Front-End Engineering Pathway. 

I was given the images to use and an example of the finished site.

I used basic HTML elements: headers, paragraph, and images.
I used basic CSS properties: font-weight, font-size, background color, etc.

**Code has been peer-reviewed and working on CSS syntax and organization.
